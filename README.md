### 1. _Lab 1: Sampling of analog signals_
This lab is devoted to the sampling of analog signals. 

* The first section deals with sampling and quantization of signals, and then .wav file decoding. 
* The second section analyzes the spectra of various pulse and periodic signals. 
* In the third section, the effect of overlapping spectra is observed when sampling signals
